Improvements
Server Enhancements

    Room Cleanup:
        If a room becomes empty (all users leave), consider removing it from the rooms map to free up memory.
        Implement a timeout for inactive rooms to handle cases where users disconnect without cleanup.

    Rate Limiting:
        Introduce rate limiting for messages to prevent spamming or abuse.

    Error Handling:
        Provide more granular error messages for debugging.
        Handle edge cases like invalid JSON payloads gracefully.

    Persistent Storage:
        Consider persisting room data (chat history, users) to a database for larger applications.

Client Enhancements

    UI Improvements:
        Add a loading indicator when connecting to the server.
        Highlight the user's own messages differently for better visibility.

    User Avatars or Colors:
        Assign avatars or unique colors to users for better differentiation in chat.

    Responsive Design:
        Ensure the chat UI scales well on mobile devices.

    Reconnection Logic:
        Implement logic to reconnect to the server if the connection drops unexpectedly.

    Sound Notifications:
        Play a sound when a new message or notification arrives to enhance the user experience.

    Message Delivery Status:
        Provide feedback on whether a message has been delivered to the server (e.g., "sending", "delivered").

    Exit Room Functionality:
        Allow users to leave a room and either join another room or go back to a "lobby" state.
